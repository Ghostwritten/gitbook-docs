*Markmap* is a javascript component that will visualize your markdown documents as mindmaps. It is useful for better navigation and overview of the content. You can see it in action online [here](http://kb.knomaton.org/multi-agent-systems/). It is also used in an [extension](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-mindmap) for Atom editor.

Suggestions for new featues are welcome, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/dundalek/markmap/issues).

## How to use

Install the component with NPM:
```
npm install markmap
```

Visualizing a markdown text consists of two steps:

1. The text is parsed and transformed into a tree representation.
2. The tree is rendered.

### Examples

To run the examples first clone the project and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dundalek/markmap.git
cd markmap
npm install
```

In the examples code there are imports like `require('../../lib/somefile')`. When using this library in your project you need to change those to `require('markmap/lib/somefile')`.

#### Browser

Run `npm start` and a browser will open with the example page where you can see how different formats are parsed and displayed. The source code for browser examples is located in  [examples/browser](examples/browser) folder.

#### Node.js

Node examples are located in [examples/node](examples/node). You can run the markdown example or others as follows:

```sh
cd examples/node
node example.markdown.js
```
